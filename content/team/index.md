### Karun â€“ Project Lead

Iâ€™m the one steering the ship. I set the technical direction and wear a lot of
hats. Sometimes even all at once. What I spend most of my time on:

- **Crafting the frontâ€‘end experience**: building the UI and interactions
- **Designing clean, maintainable code**: writing readable, reusable logic
- **Setting up CI/CD pipelines**: automating builds, tests, and releases
- **Packaging & deploying**: bundling and delivering the final product

Curious about me? Take a look at my [homepage](https://karun.sndh.dev).
